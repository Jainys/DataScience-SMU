# What is This:
This gives some stuff that I wish I knew before starting this program.  

# Pre-Course Delusions
 - I will have time on the weekends for friends/family/pets.  I went into this program thinking that I could manage the asynchronous material, homework and reading on weeknights when I wasn't in class.  Yes, you will need to dedicate some hours on non-class nights but you will also need to block time on weekends.  Most of the homework assignments in statistics are due in 72 hours.  In addition, extra tutoring and other sessions are frequently held on Saturdays or Sundays.
 - I can rely on course recordings to review information that I missed in class.  Recordings are available but fast-forwarding or pausing and restarting is cumbersome.  Playback works best without pausing or jumping around so plan to rewatch the whole session if you need to touch up on a topic addressed in class.  Alternatively, you can try to record courses on your own.  This takes some practice since the audio is not integrated with the web session.
 - The statistics course I took in undergrad is enough of an intro for me.  I should be fine.  NO!  The stats class you took 10 years ago is not enough.  Go through the points listed below to get more experience.
 - I work with databases all the time, that class should be easy.  NO! Having real-life experience with databases is sometimes a detriment when discussing theories in this class.  But yes, between the two, this course is much easier.

# Statistics
Statistics is the "hard" course unless you come from a background in it. It will take some time to learn it, so the more you can do
to get comfortable with it ahead of time, the better.  That is, if you're familar with terminology, notation and concepts,
even if you're not a master of them, it will make it easier.

For the first month, I'd estimate I did at least 20 hours a week on this class.  Knowing some of the concepts ahead of time would have cut down on it quite a bit.

Here's some suggestions
- Khan Academy has a whole series of videos on probability, statistics.  
    * Go through them to get comfortable with terms like sigma, alpha, confidence, etc.
    * Go through the inferential statistics series multiple times. There are a lot of concepts in this that will be 
      repeated in class, and it will go into much more depth.
    * I'd guess spending 20-30 hours going though this stuff ahead of time will pay off a lot. 
- Professor Leonard youtube videos.  This professor videoed an entire semester of introduction to statistics.
  His videos are good if you need an introduction or refresher
- If you prefer to sit down with a text book and read it from cover to cover, try http://onlinestatbook.com/.  This helped me immensely with getting some basic concepts down.
  

# Databases and Programming
- Find an intro to Python course online or work through some tutorials on how to do things like:
    * reading input
    * dictionaries and lists
    * connecting to a database

# Getting Started
- The biggest help for me this quarter has been connecting with classmates and collaborating on work.  It's hard, but don't be shy. Reach out to others in your classes, and start talking to them.
- We created a Google Hangout that has an on-going discussion about upcoming assignments (and some social stuff too). Its extremely helpful, if nothing else just to have everyone else to ask "when's this due again?".
- Be part of the community and discussions.  Make yourself available to be contacted outside of class.  Stay connected!
- Get your equipment and materials ready BEFORE the first class.  Go ahead and upgrade that laptop now.  Install SAS per the instructions provided.  Get that extra monitor you were thinking about.  Get your books at least 2 weeks before the first session.  You will have assignments and async material that are due PRIOR to your first stats class.
- Go to 2ds and poke around.  It's worth it to be familiar with the delivery mechanism that you will be using.  Practice using the mobile version - there are differences.
