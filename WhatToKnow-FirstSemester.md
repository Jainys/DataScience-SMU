# What is This:
This gives some stuff that I wish I knew before starting this program.  


# Statistics
Statistics is the "hard" course unless you come from a background in it. It will take some time to learn it, so the more you can do
to get comfortable with it ahead of time, the better.  That is, if you're familar with terminology, notation and concepts,
even if you're not a master of them, it will make it easier.

For the first month, I'd estimate I did at least 20 hours a week on this class.  Knowing some of the concepts ahead of time would have cut down on it quite a bit.

Here's some suggestions to get going faster
- Khan Academy has a whole series of videos on probability, statistics.  
    * Go through them to get comfortable with terms like sigma, alpha, confidence, etc.
    * Go through the inferential statistics series multiple times. There are a lot of concepts in this that will be 
      repeated in class, and it will go into much mor depth.
    * I'd guess spending 20-30 hours going though this stuff ahead of time will pay off a lot. 
- Professor Leonard youtube videos.  This professor videoed an entire semester of introduction to statistics.
  His videos are good if you need an introduction or refresher.  However, it's a full semester, so it takes a lot of time. 
- There are other youtube videos on doing statistics. Find someone you like, and watch their stuff.
- http://onlinestatbook.com/ is worth going through.


### SAS
You'll want to install a local copy of SAS.  The first two courses in statistics use this, and R comees later.
The official documents say it takes 4-6 hours.  In reality, it took a lot longer.  (12ish hours.)  The better network connection you have, the faster it will go.  Use a hardwire, not wireless if possible.

A number of people reported using SAS University edition, and liking it a lot better. The install is a lot smaller, only about a 1/2 hours.

People on Mac's have been having issues and have to use the citrix version. I don't know what their work-around have been besides installing on a virtual machine.


# Databases and Programming
- Find an intro to Python course online or work through some tutorials on how to do things like:
    * reading input
    * dictionarys and lists
    * connecting to a database
- In class, you can use version 2.7 or 3. Most the stuff we looked at was version 2.7.


# Other Stuff
- The biggest help for me this quarter has been connecting with classmates and collaborating on work.  It's hard, but don't be shy. Reach out to others in your classes, and start talking to them.
- We created a Google Hangout that has an on-going discussion about upcoming assignments (and some social stuff too). Its extremely helpful, if nothing else just to have everyone else to ask "when's this due again?".
- Be part of the community and discussions.
- Try to connect with people in different sections. Some weeks, one section may get further in a lecture than other weeks, so it'd good to have someone else to compare to that has a slightly different perspective.
- SMU uses Office365 for Business, so you'll get a OneDrive folder (as well as licenses for the Office suite). This, dropbox, googledrive...will be helpful to share with everyone.
